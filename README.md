A project aimed to practice creating algorithms to solve challenges with data.
Contributors: Aidan Abbott & Andrey Shor

This project aims to improve our ability to manipulate data for prediction, classification, and forecasting purposes. This project will be separate into phases with the first phase being the "learning" phase. This phase consists of developing pre-existing algorithms such as linear regression, KNN, naive bayes, etc. from scratch so that a foundational understanding is developed.
